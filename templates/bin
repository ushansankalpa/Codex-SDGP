		There is a strong tendency among the speaking
community to trivialise the capacity of sign as a full
communication medium. It is a common assumption
that sign language, being iconic in nature, is a universal
language shared by the deaf communities of the world.
In fact countries which share the same spoken language
(e.g. English in the cases of Britain, Ireland and
America) do not necessarily employ the same form of
sign ( BSL, ISL and ASL respectively). Certainly
iconicity plays a stronger role in sign language than
sound symbolism does in spoken language but, as with
any language, there is a strong tendency to move from
iconicity to arbitrariness (see Klima & Bellugi 1979).

		The fluid articulation of animated sign language
		from English in'put represents a unique linguistic
		challenge of cross-modal translation. There is a sizeable
		body of sign language users world-wide, for whom such
		technology can provide valuable tools for education and
		informatiort access. From a linguistic perspective, the
		pursuit of cross-modal translation poses new problems
		in translation and generation, and forces us to question
		our conceptions of language universals.
